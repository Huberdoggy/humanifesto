# 🧒 Humanifesto

Humanifesto is a Stremio add-on that makes *"what should I watch next?"* feel human again; no extra accounts, no Trakt/IMDB scraping, no infinite feed. Just tell it what you loved, and it returns a small, hand-picked list of films and shows that match the vibe, not the algorithm.

## 👤 Authorship and Use

Humanifesto is crafted by [Kyle Huber](https://linkedin.com/in/kyle-james-my-filenames) and is currently implemented and tested against the Stremio web dev environment as a portfolio proof-of-concept. It's not published to a public add-on host by design, to keep maintainership and hosting overhead minimal. The codebase is fully deployable to any Node-friendly host with HTTPS if future maintainers wish to run it in the wild.
